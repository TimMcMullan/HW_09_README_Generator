Professional README.md Generator
This is an application that, when invoked with the command line "node index.js" initializes a list of questions the user answers to populate the README.md file. The file then automatedly generates the README.md file, properly formatted, and builds link to appropriate URLs.

You will need the core node as well as inquirer.

Save time and make sure your README.md file properly relays information about your application.
